Subject: Following up: Referral Request for {job_title}

Hi {first_name},

I wanted to follow up on my email from earlier this week regarding a potential referral for the {job_title} position at {company}.

I understand you're busy, so no worries if you haven't had a chance to review my resume yet. If you're able to provide a referral, I would be very grateful. If not, I completely understand.

Thank you for your time!

Best regards,
{YOUR_NAME}
